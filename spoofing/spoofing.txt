Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.

The vulnerability in the initial code lies in the lack of security measures against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks and session hijacking.

In the initial code:
- The server doesn't implement CSRF protection, allowing attackers to perform actions on behalf of authenticated users without their consent.
- The session cookie is not marked as `httpOnly` and lacks the `SameSite` attribute, making it susceptible to session hijacking via client-side script execution.

The secure version addresses these vulnerabilities:
- It ensures that the session cookie is marked as `httpOnly`, preventing client-side JavaScript from accessing it, thereby mitigating session hijacking.
- It includes the `SameSite` attribute in the session cookie, which restricts the cookie to be sent only in first-party contexts, protecting against CSRF attacks.
- Additionally, the secret key for session encryption is passed as a command-line argument, enhancing the security of session management.

Spoofing violates the Confidentiality and Integrity CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability) properties:

Confidentiality: Spoofing attacks can compromise the confidentiality of data by allowing unauthorized access to sensitive information. For example, in a spoofing attack, an attacker might impersonate a legitimate user or system to gain access to confidential data.

Integrity: Spoofing attacks can undermine the integrity of data by allowing unauthorized parties to modify or manipulate it. For instance, an attacker might spoof the identity of a trusted source to send malicious data or commands, leading to unauthorized changes to data or system settings.

By impersonating legitimate entities or sources, spoofing attacks can deceive systems or users into disclosing sensitive information or accepting unauthorized actions, thus compromising the confidentiality and integrity of data and systems.
